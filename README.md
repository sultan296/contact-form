# Contact Form

I built a fully functional contact form using React JS that allows users to send emails directly from the browser without needing a backend server. It collects inputs like name, email, and message, then sends them using Web3Forms, a third-party service that simplifies email handling on the client side. I used custom CSS to make the form visually appealing. The project is practical, clean, and easily adaptable for real-world use, like portfolio websites or landing pages.
